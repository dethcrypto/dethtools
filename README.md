# Getting started ðŸ“š

## Motivation

The Ethereum world has encountered a lot of minor problems related to the
developer experience. We have to do a lot of conversions, data decoding and
encoding. There are some tools on the web, but they are unorganised and most of
them are left unmaintained and in overall poor state. We've decided to change
that with dEth Tools.

## How does it work?

Just go to https://tools.deth.net/

# Ideas ðŸ’¡

We would love to hear any feedback from our users. If you have any ideas related
to the dEth Tools - let us know. We want to provide the best DX for average
ethereum developer!
